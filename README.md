# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this page is to provide access to a filterable dataset of UFO sightings to the public so that people can draw their own conclusions about the presence of alien life on Earth and their motives.

## Use
[!Unfiltered Data](https://github.com/deklund76/UFOs/blob/main/resources/unfilteredData.png)
The data is displayed in full on the article page, but it's a lot to take in at once.

[!Filtered Data](https://github.com/deklund76/UFOs/blob/main/resources/filteredData.png)
To filter the data, simply enter the desired value in one of the search bars on the left and press enter. The data will now be filtered to only show entries that match the search criteria.

[!Data filtered with multiple criteria](https://github.com/deklund76/UFOs/blob/main/resources/multipleFilters.png)
You can even filter the data using multiple criteria

## Room for Improvement
The filters work great when passing exact values, but they're case-sensitive and don't have any kind of parsing for partial matches. To improve the page, functionalities allowing for sorting by criteria and filtering on a range of dates could be added.
